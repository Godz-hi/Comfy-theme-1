## 📥 Installation
### 🔌 Powercord

</br>Open a terminal and run the following commands
```sh
cd (powercord dir)/src/Powercord/themes
```
```sh
git clone https://github.com/NYRI4/Comfy-theme
```
* `(powercord dir)` is frequently C:/Users/USERNAME/powercord
* Note : Some features will only work in some languages (French, English, Spanish and Deutsch) cause I'm bad at coding.
